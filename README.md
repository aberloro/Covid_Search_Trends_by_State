# Covid_Search_Trends_by_State

## Overview of Project

  ### Background
  
  December of 2019 marked the first record of an unknown pneumonia virus in Wuhan, China.  By mid-January, the virus was identified as a novel coronavirus and the first case is recored in Washington State, USA.  The WHO declared a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. (CDC 2022)  According to the New York Times, vaccination rates are clearly divided along political lines. (NYT 2021) 
  
  This begs the question, what other Covid-19 related behavior can be correlated along political lines? Knowing that humans tend towards confirmation bias, or a pattern of seeking out information that affirms their current beliefs (Britannica 2019), can a state's dominant political party be predicted by Google search trends on Covid and vaccination? 
  
  ### Deliverables
   - Presentation
   - Database
   - Machine Learning Model
   - Dashboard
 
  ### Resources
   - Technology: SQLite, SQL Alchemy, Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebook, Python 3.7, Tableau, Postgres, PGAdmin
   - Data Sources 
     - [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=US):  Google Trends outputs data that can be downloaded as CSV files based on inout parameters determined by the user.  Various Covid-related search terms were viewed across state lines, from November 2019 to present day.  
     - [United States Census Bureau Tables](https://www.census.gov/): Survey and census data is avalable and filtered by year, topics, and location. Education achiemement by state data was retrieved. MAYBE NOT
     - [MIT Election Data + Science Lab](https://electionlab.mit.edu/data): Election results are available for federal, state, and local elections by state, district, county, or precinct. Historical presenential and senate election results were retrieved by state.  
     - [Cook Partisan Voting Index](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/most-democratic-states): The Partisan Voting Index, PVI, is a measurement of how much a state leans Republican or Democratic compared to the nation as a whole.

# Covid_Search_Trends_by_State

## Overview of Project

  ### Background
  
  December of 2019 marked the first record of an unknown pneumonia virus in Wuhan, China.  By mid-January, the virus was identified as a novel coronavirus and the first case is recorded in Washington State, USA.  The WHO declared a global pandemic on March 11, 2020.  The first Covid 19 vaccine was cleared throught the FDA Emergency Use Authorization in December 2020. (CDC 2022)  According to the New York Times, vaccination rates are clearly divided along political lines. (NYT 2021) 
  
  This begs the question, what other Covid-19 related behavior can be correlated along political lines? Knowing that humans tend towards confirmation bias, or a pattern of seeking out information that affirms their current beliefs (Britannica 2019), can a state's dominant political party be predicted by Google search trends on Covid and vaccination? 
  
  ### Deliverables
   - [Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wsX42ik5_tP_MOTY9e7HShyg4vSNRknh32vvGKSwO0c/edit?usp=sharing)
   - Database
   - Machine Learning Model
   - Dashboard
 
  ### Resources
   - Technology: SQLite, SQL Alchemy, Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebook, Python 3.7, Tableau, Postgres, PGAdmin
   - Data Sources 
     - [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=US):  Google Trends outputs data that can be downloaded as CSV files based on input parameters determined by the user.  Various Covid-related search terms were viewed across state lines, from November 30, 2019 to April 21, 2022.  
     - [United States Census Bureau Tables](https://www.census.gov/): Survey and census data is available and filtered by year, topics, and location. Education achiemement by state data was retrieved. MAYBE NOT
     - [MIT Election Data + Science Lab](https://electionlab.mit.edu/data): Election results are available for federal, state, and local elections by state, district, county, or precinct. Historical presidential and senate election results were retrieved by state.  MAYBE NOT
     - [Cook Partisan Voting Index](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/most-democratic-states): The Partisan Voting Index, PVI, is a measurement of how much a state leans Republican or Democratic compared to the nation as a whole.

 ### Postgres Database
 
  - This project utilized a locally hosted Postgres database accessed through the PGAdmin management tool. 
  - The schema to set up tables in the database can be found [here](https://github.com/aberloro/Covid_Search_Trends_by_State/blob/main/SQL/schema).
  - Please see the ERD below:

 ### Machine Learning Model
  - Supervised learning is used when classes are known, in this case Republican or Democrat.
  - This project utilized logistic regression to predict a state's dominant political party based on covid vaccine srearch trends from that state.

 ### Results / Dashboard - Tableau
  - A state's dominant political party can be predicted from vaccine search strends with 85% accuracy using a logistic regression model.
